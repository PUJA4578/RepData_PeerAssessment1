## Introduction

This report analyzes personal activity monitoring data collected at 5-minute intervals over two months in 2012. The data contains the number of steps taken, dates, and interval identifiers.

## Loading and Preprocessing the Data
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)

# Load the dataset (make sure 'activity.csv' is in the same folder as this .Rmd file)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Convert date column to Date type
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)

# Show first few rows of the dataset
head(activity)
## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?
# Calculate total steps per day ignoring missing values
total_steps_per_day <- activity %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))

# Histogram of total steps per day
hist(total_steps_per_day$total_steps, 
     main = "Total Steps per Day",
     xlab = "Number of Steps",
     col = "blue",
     breaks = 20)

# Calculate mean and median total steps per day
mean_steps <- mean(total_steps_per_day$total_steps)
median_steps <- median(total_steps_per_day$total_steps)

mean_steps
median_steps
## What is the average daily activity pattern?
# Calculate average steps per 5-minute interval
avg_steps_interval <- activity %>%
  filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarise(mean_steps = mean(steps))

# Plot average daily activity pattern
plot(avg_steps_interval$interval, avg_steps_interval$mean_steps, 
     type = "l",
     main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern",
     xlab = "5-minute Interval",
     ylab = "Average Number of Steps")

# Find interval with maximum average steps
max_interval <- avg_steps_interval$interval[which.max(avg_steps_interval$mean_steps)]
max_interval
## Imputing missing values
# Count total missing values in steps
missing_values <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))
missing_values

# Impute missing values with the mean for that 5-minute interval
activity_imputed <- activity
interval_means <- avg_steps_interval

activity_imputed$steps <- ifelse(
  is.na(activity_imputed$steps),
  interval_means$mean_steps[match(activity_imputed$interval, interval_means$interval)],
  activity_imputed$steps
)

# Check that missing values have been filled
sum(is.na(activity_imputed$steps))
## Total steps per day after imputing missing values
# Calculate total steps per day after imputing missing values
total_steps_imputed <- activity_imputed %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))

# Histogram for total steps per day after imputation
hist(total_steps_imputed$total_steps, 
     main = "Total Steps per Day (Imputed Data)",
     xlab = "Number of Steps",
     col = "green",
     breaks = 20)

# Calculate mean and median for the imputed dataset
mean_imputed <- mean(total_steps_imputed$total_steps)
median_imputed <- median(total_steps_imputed$total_steps)

mean_imputed
median_imputed
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
# Create factor variable for weekday/weekend
activity_imputed$day_type <- ifelse(
  weekdays(activity_imputed$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"),
  "weekend",
  "weekday"
)
activity_imputed$day_type <- factor(activity_imputed$day_type, levels = c("weekday", "weekend"))

# Calculate average steps per interval by day type
avg_steps_daytype <- activity_imputed %>%
  group_by(interval, day_type) %>%
  summarise(mean_steps = mean(steps))

# Panel plot comparing weekday and weekend activity patterns
xyplot(mean_steps ~ interval | day_type, 
       data = avg_steps_daytype,
       type = "l",
       layout = c(1, 2),
       xlab = "5-minute Interval",
       ylab = "Average Number of Steps",
       main = "Activity Patterns: Weekday vs Weekend")
